    <h1>About SpatterGrapes</h1>
    <p>
      I created this profile and started playing Roblox awhile back. Curiously, I met a few people so that I could see for myself. 
      I even made a few friends along the way. As much as I care about safety.

    <h2>Artwork &amp; Design</h2>
    <p>
      I have a talent for drawing pictures and sketches of different things, including people. However, it is not perfect. Most of my 
      artwork consists of professional designs, doodles, and pixel art, which is not entirely full of quality and life, but still good 
      in a way.
    </p>
    <h2>Source Code Design &amp; Experience</h2>
    <p>
      As a developer of a Roblox experience, I am versed with JavaScript, C, Python, Lua, HTML5, and XML. However, I am not an absolute 
      expert in Python, and I do not entirely use C often, as I lack the tools for this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Normally, when creating a Roblox experience, I take safety precautions to ensure that online dating is not a problem, and for this, 
      I start by layering a Roblox filter beneath, and then analyzing the filtered text using third party services. The filtered text is 
      then analysed, where action is taken when needed. Because Roblox's pre-built safety filters are not enough to catch everything, it 
      is imparitive to use third-party security to scan the text afterwards. This does not replace the built-in filter entirely, as Roblox's 
      Community Rules require developers to use the internal APIs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I use my talent of HTML5 design to create simple webpages. I have not learned CSS entirely, but this is something I can learn down the line.
