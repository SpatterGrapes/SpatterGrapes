    <h1>About Spattergrapes</h1>
    <p>
      I am Spattergrapes, and I made my own Github.io page with links to all my other social media accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      My hobbies include programming, drawing pictures, and collecting stuff -- in Trove.. Yes, I played this multiplayer online game. I used to enjoy playing Roblox, but their moderation quality is not as good, and 
      this of course sparked a lot of drama. It has been very evident when a group was created for the purpose of bypassing the username filter, which has been a problem for far too long. I have had it with the fact 
      that the filter's accuracy is lower compared to most platforms which had strict filters.
    </p>
    <p>
      You probably seen a grape with horns when you played Trove and met me. I built my cornerstone using some purple blocks I collected from the Cursed Vale. I will admit that I am actually proud of what I built.
